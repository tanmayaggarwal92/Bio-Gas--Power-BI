This Power BI project has provided valuable insights into the operational efficiency of the waste-to-energy biogas plant. By addressing the identified inefficiencies and implementing the recommended strategies, the plant can optimize its performance, maximize energy production, and contribute more effectively to sustainable energy solutions. The visualizations and analyses facilitated by Power BI have been instrumental in uncovering these insights and guiding the recommendations.
